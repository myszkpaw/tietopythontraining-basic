# In chess, the bishop moves diagonally, any number of squares.
# Given two different squares of the chessboard, determine whether a bishop can go from the first to the second in one move.
# The program receives as input four numbers from 1 to 8, specifying the column and row numbers of the starting square and
# the column and row numbers of the ending square.
# The program should output YES if a Bishop can go from the first square to the second in one move, or NO otherwise.

x1 = int(input())
y1 = int(input())

y2 = int(input())

if abs(x2 - x1) == abs(y2 - y1):
    print("YES")
else:
